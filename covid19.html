      <h2>Covid-19 Measures</h2>
      <h4>
        We are taking every measure to ensure that your time at Trent Valley
        Lanes and Sandy Beach are Safe and Enjoyable! Below are those listed
        measures:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Everyone is required to wear a mask to enter/exit and while moving
            around within Trent Valley Lanes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mask removal is permitted while in your assigned bowling area, or
            while seated at a table in the lounge, or seated at a table on the
            patio. Masks must be worn at all times when you leave your assigned
            bowling area, stand up from your lounge or patio table, or cannot
            maintain at least 2 meters from anyone that is not part of your
            social circle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Washroom facilities are available but donâ€™t forget to wear your mask
            and wash your hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hand sanitizer is available throughout the facilities, and soap and
            water in each of the bathrooms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lane areas, tables, and house bowling balls are sanitized upon
            departure of each group of bowlers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Floor markings have been added to help maintain safe distancing.
            This includes no hanging out around any of the counters, with the
            exception of getting shoes or paying your bill.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bowlers will be assigned 2 lanes per Social Circle. As Social
            Circles can include up to 10 people, bowlers are encouraged to bowl
            within their Social Circles to give others an opportunity to bowl as
            we only have enough lanes to accommodate 3 Social Circles. Each
            Social Circle is a maximum of 10 people, bowling or not.
          </li>
